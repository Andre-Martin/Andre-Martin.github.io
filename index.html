				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! My name's Andre Martin and I'm currently a full time student at Langara College pursuing a Diploma in Computer Studies and work part time for the City of Richmond as an Instructor/Lifeguard 1. Some of my hobbies
					include swimming, going to the gym to workout, and going on hikes.
				</p>
				<p>
					My skillset is very team-oriented as I am able to get along in a team, be dependable, able to follow instructions as well as give out instructions, able to multi-task, and very punctual.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've participated in many volunteer experiences such as being a leader at my school's Grade 8 Camp during my senior year in high school and worked with other seniors as a team to put together an unforgettable experience
					for the Grade 8's. This is one of the experiences that showcases my skillset.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the volunteer experiences, I also have a few years of work experience as well. My first job was at McDonalds and working there was an excellent experience as I was thrusted into a fast-paced work
					environment, working alongside many crew members. This job help bolster my public speaking skills as well as solidify working as a team player.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm currently working on a project for my CPSC 2350 class here's a link to the <a href="https://github.com/Andre-Martin/GoodGame">repository</a>. This project is about creating an AI chatbot web application
					where you have the choice of searching for what kind of board games you like or chatting with the AI chatbot to help find recommendations.
